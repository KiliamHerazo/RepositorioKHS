    <h1>What is XML?</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>XML stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage</li>
        <li>XML is a <strong>markup language</strong> much like HTML</li>
        <li>XML was designed to <strong>describe data</strong></li>
        <li>XML tags are not predefined. You must <strong>define your own tags</strong></li>
        <li>XML uses a <strong>Document Type Definition</strong> (DTD) or an <strong>XML schema</strong> to describe the data</li>
        <li>XML with a DTD or XML schema is designed to be <strong>self-descriptive</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The main difference between XML and HTML</h2>

    <p><strong>XML was designed to carry data.</strong></p>
    <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML.<br>XML and HTML were designed with different goals:</p>
    <p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what deta is.<br>HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks.</p>
    <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>XML does not DO anything</h2>
    <p><strong>XML was not designed to DO anything.</strong></p>
    <p>Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was createdto structure, store and to send information.</p>
    <p>The following example is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:</p>

    <table width="320" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="1" >
        <tr>
           <td >
           <p> < note> <br>< to>Tove< to><br>< from>Jani< /from><br>< heading>Reminder< /hesding><br>< body>Don'r forget me this weekend!< /body><br>< /note></p>
           </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The note has a header and a message body. It also has sender and receiver information.
            But still, this XML document does not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped
            in XML tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it.</p>
